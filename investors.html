        <p>Hello dear investor! Thank you for considering being a part of Selfie Star. This page is exclusively curated
            for you to understand who we are, and what we are about, and what impact we are planning to make in the
            industry. The various resources here are intended to suffice as an introduction to our company and products
            - without the team to explain it. While it should give you the facts and the information, consider talking
            to the team by reaching out to us to get a sense of the passion and the creativity that drives the
            innovation beyond this information.
            <br>
            <br>
            The company brief outlines the summary of the team, the company, and the business plan in one short page.
            The remote pitch is a detailed description of our product, market fit, revenue model, and growth presented
            by our team. The product video is a teaser into our product itself and finally, the slide deck is the slides
            encompassing our market opportunity.
        </p>
